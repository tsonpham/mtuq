Learning Python and ObsPy
=========================

To avoid reinventing the wheel, MTUQ makes extensive use of `ObsPy <https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki>`_, a Python package for seismology.  If you're not familiar with Python or ObsPy, an excellent place to start is the `ObsPy tutorial <http://docs.obspy.org/tutorial/index.html>`_.
