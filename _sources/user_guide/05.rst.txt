Visualization galleries
=======================

As illustrated in the `examples <https://github.com/uafgeotools/mtuq/blob/master/examples>`_, MTUQ can be used to carry out grid searches over moment tensors, double couples, and forces. 

The output of `mtuq.grid_search` in each of these cases is a data structure that can be passed directly to visualization functions.  Examples are given below.
